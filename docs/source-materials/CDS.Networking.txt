Networking today and Switch Config
About this week

Welcome to the first week of your networking journey with Cisco Networking Academy!

We’ll begin with Module 1: Networking Today, where you’ll explore how networks connect people and devices, the types of networks (LAN, WAN, Internet), and trends like cloud computing, BYOD, and smart homes. You’ll also learn about basic network security and career paths in IT.

Then we move into Module 2: Basic Switch and End Device Configuration, where you’ll get hands-on with Cisco IOS. You’ll learn how to:

Access and navigate network devices via CLI
Configure hostnames, passwords, and IP addresses
Save and verify device configurations
You’ll also be introduced to NetAcad.com, your learning platform, and Packet Tracer, Cisco’s simulation tool for practicing network setups.

Protocols and Models
About this week

This week, we’ll explore how devices communicate across networks using protocols and models. You’ll learn:

Why rules and standards matter in network communication.
How protocols like TCP/IP and OSI structure data exchange.
The role of organizations like IEEE and IETF in ensuring interoperability.
How data is packaged (encapsulation) and addressed for delivery.
📌 Note: Tuesday’s classes are cancelled as I’ll be attending a sector conference.
📎 I’ll upload an extra Packet Tracer assignment so you can practise the Cisco IOScommands once more.

Learning activities

You will work with this 02_Exercise PT - Implementing Basic Connectivity Tuesday since classes are cancelled.

This exercise is specifically designed to practice using the CLI and configuring switches via command-line commands in Packet Tracer. You'll be setting up switch names, passwords, VLAN interfaces, and verifying connectivity—all through the CLI.

Look at this poster to remember the modes and promst in CLI

If you like to check your understanding - see this walkthrough of the exercise.



Wendesday

On Wednesday, you'll be working with protocols, focusing on both reference models and real-life implementations. The OSI Model and TCP/IP Model are the two primary reference models used to understand how network protocols operate across layers. Each layer in these models has distinct responsibilities—from physical transmission to application-level interactions.

We will work with this exercise and hopefully we will dive into a labsetup.

Ipv4 addressing
About this week

This week, we’ll concentrate on two essential networking skills: subnetting and understanding classless IPv4 addressing.

Key Topics
Subnetting Fundamentals:
Learn how to divide networks into smaller segments using subnet masks and prefix lengths (slash notation). You’ll practice calculating subnets for various network sizes and requirements.
Classless IPv4 Addressing (CIDR):
Move beyond traditional classful addressing and discover how Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) allows for flexible network design. You’ll work with different prefix lengths (e.g., /24, /16, /8) and see how they impact the number of hosts and subnets.
Efficient Network Segmentation:
Explore how subnetting and classless addressing help optimize IP address usage, minimize waste, and improve network performance and security.

Learning activities

In our next sessions, we will dive into classless addressing (CIDR)  and move on to subnetting IPv4. This is one of the most challenging – but also most important – topics in networking.

We will:

Recap how classful addressing (A, B, C) worked historically.

Understand how CIDR (classless addressing) replaced it, making IP address use far more efficient.

Review subnetting (breaking a network into smaller parts).

Practice calculating subnets, masks, and address ranges.

This is tricky at first, but don’t worry – we’ll work step by step with examples and exercises

This weeks presentations

ICMP and the Transport layer
About this week

ICMP & Transport Layer
We’ll focus on how networks test connections and move data reliably:

Use ICMP tools (like ping and traceroute) to check and troubleshoot network connectivity.
Understand how the transport layer (TCP and UDP) manages end-to-end data delivery, including reliability, speed, and port numbers.
By the end of the week, you’ll be able to test network paths and explain how data gets from one application to another—reliably or fast, depending on the protocol.
