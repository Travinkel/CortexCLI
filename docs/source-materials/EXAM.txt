• You must document policies for who can access what.

**README.md requirements**

When you submit your source code, make a README.md file in the root of the git repo

*(don't give me some pdf report - you're a developer now).*

In your README you should at least:

• Document security policies for who can access what (authorization)
• Document / explain environment, configuration and linting.
• Summarize the current state of the project (what works, known bugs, etc)

**There are no upper or lower character limit to the README.md.**

Just make it worth reading. You may add any chapter to the README.md that you think is valuable to have (either to yourself or to the assessors looking through your code).

**The exam**

**Programming II + CDS Security exam procedure:**

The oral examination lasts for 30 minutes, including evaluation.

**Systems development exam procedure:**

The project is

**presented by the student in 10 minutes**

, followed by an examination

**dialogue**

. The entire exam lasts 20 minutes including grade evaluation.

**The following details are true about both exams:**

• You will be given a

**combined grade**

based on your project and oral examination.
    ◦ The grades can of course differ within a group with the same project submission. 
    ◦ Failure to demonstrate code ownership and understanding of the curriculum as a whole will result in examination failure - regardless of the written submission.
• The exams are

**internal**

(meaning two employees are EASV will be present as assessors).
• I recommend you have some sort of a

**structured presentation**

to guide you. This could be a slideshow or something else to guide you when you speak.
    ◦ If you show code in a slideshow, please make the images / font super large. 
• If you demo the finished product during your presentation,

**please don't spend more than 1 minute showing the graphical user interface.**

The majority of your time should be focused on implementation details that demonstrate you understand the technologies.

*(We've already seen and used your program by the time you're at the exam).*

• The

**primary**

person you will be speaking with during the examination dialogue will be me (Alex). 
    ◦ I will ask questions

**about your code**

. You must therefore demonstrate full ownership of the code.
    ◦ Questions may also prompt you to explain theory based on your solution, like "Why would you use TestContainers for your tests?"
    ◦

**I will not ask questions about things you did not use**

. For instance, if you don't use Bogus for creating random data for tests, I don't ask about that particular library.

**How to get help during the project period**

**Office hours with guaranteed physical presence**

: I will be physically present at the academy every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday from 9 o'clock to 1 o'clock.

**For exceptions to these, please see the "important dates".**

*(Since exceptions also include sick days, etc.)*

**Location**

: I can be found at the office (just walk in next to the reception and go to the very back of the office).

**Online help**

: Email me via aup@easv.dk.
• If it's a very small thing, we can simply solve it right away via text on Outlook.
• If it's a bigger thing and I'm present ad the academy, I'll reply that I'm at the office.
• If it's a bigger thing and I'm not present, I will help you using

https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/

and

**Zoom,**

so please have both installed and configured.

**Case details**

**Dead Pigeons 🐦**

**Introduction**

The local sports club, Jerne IF, receives financial support using a game called “Dead Pigeons” played by supporters of the club. There are issues regarding managing and scaling the current non-digital variant of the game, so a web solution is proposed.

**Rules**

“Dead pigeons” is a lottery-style game in which a number of people guess winning numbers from a board.   
The administrator will draw 3 random numbers by the end of each week.
These numbers are the winning sequence. They are drawn out of a physical hat and can be entered by the admin on the web app (no random number generator – just a number selection menu). 
Each player places 5-8 numbers on their boards in an attempt to guess the winning sequence. 
The total sum used for prizes is 70% of the revenue from selling the boards to the players. The remaining 30% is kept by the sports facility. 
Pretty simple, right? Here are the caveats... 
• There can be any number of winners, since any number of boards can include the winning sequence. 
• A singular player can purchase any number of boards. 
• 
    ◦ They may play the same sequence any number of times or multiple different sequences. 
• 
    ◦ If they get multiple boards with the winning sequence, they will get a share of the winning sum multiple times. 
• 
    ◦ The purchase price for each board is dependent on the number of numbers you select in that sequence. Below is the table of prices: 5 fields 20 DKK 6 fields 40 DKK 7 fields 80 DKK 8 fields 160 DKK 
 
• The numbers on the board will always be 1-16.
• Once the board administrator has drawn the winning numbers, no more guesses can be made / players can join that game. 
• 
    ◦ Additionally, players may only join the game until 5 o’clock Saturday (PM, afternoon) Danish local time. 
• 
    ◦ The next game automatically starts once the admin has entered the winning numbers for an existing. 
• Players can choose to repeat boards for X number of games. (For example, play the same board for 10 weeks in a row). It should also be possible to stop the repeating board (opt-out of the game). 
• You must use a “balance” system where payments made to Jerne IF increase the account balance and purchased boards decrease account balance. 
• 
    ◦ The balance cannot be negative. The player will have to start off by submitting money words the balance, and then they can play for X number of weeks. 
• 
    ◦ When players deposit money towards the “balance”, they should be able to attach the MobilePay transaction number  
• It is always possible for the administrator to check transactions by transaction number in MobilePay.  
• 
    ◦ By default, a transaction is “pending” until it is approved by an admin. Once it has been approved it will proceed towards the balance and can be used to purchase boards. 
• 
    ◦ Winning sums do not go towards the balance: Prize money is handled by the admins separately. 
• Some players will play digitally (your app) while others play physically. They participate in the same “round”, meaning your app simply must keep track of the digital participants.  
• 
    ◦ When the administrators figure out how much prize money to pay each winner, they calculate this manually by adding in the physical participants. Your application should therefore not calculate total prize for each winner. 
• The administrator should be able to get a clear overview of data in the application with everything being timestamped: 
• 
    ◦ The admin requires full CRUD on players  
• 
    ◦ 
        ▪ The player is registered by the admin with full name, phone number and email address. 
• 
    ◦ 
        ▪ The player can be marked as active or inactive by the Admin. Only active players may buy boards / participate in games. By default a player is inactive. 
• 
    ◦ Games (the weekly occurrence)
• 
    ◦ 
        ▪ Overview should show the history for all games. This includes: 
• 
    ◦ 
        ▪ What boards each player has played + indicate whether they are winning boards. 
• 
    ◦ 
        ▪ The total number of winning boards to quickly add together with the physical boards. 
• Sequence / number ordering of guesses and winner numbers don’t matter. 
• 
    ◦ Example: someone guessing 4-1-7-2-5 while the winning numbers are 2-5-1 is still a valid win.

**By the end of the project, the group which most gracefully and production-ready fulfills the requirements (given you accept to) will put the system into production for Jerne IF.**

**Example starter app & testing walkthrough video**

Here's my boilerplate setup which you may use for inspiration for your setups. It includes authentication and all of the stuff we've worked with in programming + testing:

https://github.com/uldahlalex/starter-25

I'm i the process of exchanging my work laptop, so I'll record a video explaining the testing setup soon and upload. (Thank you for your patience).

**Review meetings**

You will get a chance to present your current work in progress (to get feedback and ask questions to the stakeholder).
The timetable / order of review meetings can be found below prior to the meetings. The dates can be found in the "important dates" section in this document (at the top).

**Q&A & general advice**

During the project announcement you may have some questions. If I think the questions and answers may be very valuable to others at a later point in time, I'll upload them here. I'll also add in tips for solving the exam case.

**Tip 1: State-less API.**

It might be tempting to make some automation that creates a new game every X days / using schedulers / etc. I will strongly advise

**against**

this. I recommend simply seeding "inactive" games into the database for each week the next 20 years using a loop, and then the function that "ends" a game (by publishing the winning numbers) simply makes the next week "active" as a single database transaction. This is the least failure-prone implementation i can think of.

**Tip 2: Soft-delete everything**

. You want full history of all activities, so no hard deletes that completely erase data.

**Tip 3: "Balance" is calculated**

as a sum of approved transactions minus all "board purchases" so it's always verifiable by history if a person has positive balance. That means there is no "balance column"; It is simply a product of past history!    Last modified: Monday, 17 November 2025, 12:44 PMJump to...                     Jump to...                     Announcements                     Choose Your 3 Elective Courses                     Elective Course Descriptions                     Semester Description (semestergrundlag)                     Weekly Schedules, Calendars & Rooms                     Create Your 3rd Semester Exam Project Group Here                     Course Plan 2nd Semester                     Exam Project                     Review Meeting #1 - Schedule 06-05-2025                     Review Meeting #1.5 - Schedule 15-05-2025                     Review Meeting #2 - Schedule 26-05-2025                     Self select groups - 1st year Exam                     Material from Belman                     CS 1st year exam information.pptx                     Guide for using Wiseflow                     Vejledning i brugen af Wiseflow (Danish guide)                     Kahoot Exam training questions (SCO)                     Kahoot!

**Case details**

**Dead Pigeons 🐦**

**Introduction**

The local sports club, Jerne IF, receives financial support using a game called “Dead Pigeons” played by supporters of the club. There are issues regarding managing and scaling the current non-digital variant of the game, so a web solution is proposed.

**Rules**

“Dead pigeons” is a lottery-style game in which a number of people guess winning numbers from a board.   
The administrator will draw 3 random numbers by the end of each week.
These numbers are the winning sequence. They are drawn out of a physical hat and can be entered by the admin on the web app (no random number generator – just a number selection menu). 
Each player places 5-8 numbers on their boards in an attempt to guess the winning sequence. 
The total sum used for prizes is 70% of the revenue from selling the boards to the players. The remaining 30% is kept by the sports facility. 
Pretty simple, right? Here are the caveats... 
• There can be any number of winners, since any number of boards can include the winning sequence. 
• A singular player can purchase any number of boards. 
• 
    ◦ They may play the same sequence any number of times or multiple different sequences. 
• 
    ◦ If they get multiple boards with the winning sequence, they will get a share of the winning sum multiple times. 
• 
    ◦ The purchase price for each board is dependent on the number of numbers you select in that sequence. Below is the table of prices: 5 fields 20 DKK 6 fields 40 DKK 7 fields 80 DKK 8 fields 160 DKK 
 
• The numbers on the board will always be 1-16.
• Once the board administrator has drawn the winning numbers, no more guesses can be made / players can join that game. 
• 
    ◦ Additionally, players may only join the game until 5 o’clock Saturday (PM, afternoon) Danish local time. 
• 
    ◦ The next game automatically starts once the admin has entered the winning numbers for an existing. 
• Players can choose to repeat boards for X number of games. (For example, play the same board for 10 weeks in a row). It should also be possible to stop the repeating board (opt-out of the game). 
• You must use a “balance” system where payments made to Jerne IF increase the account balance and purchased boards decrease account balance. 
• 
    ◦ The balance cannot be negative. The player will have to start off by submitting money words the balance, and then they can play for X number of weeks. 
• 
    ◦ When players deposit money towards the “balance”, they should be able to attach the MobilePay transaction number  
• It is always possible for the administrator to check transactions by transaction number in MobilePay.  
• 
    ◦ By default, a transaction is “pending” until it is approved by an admin. Once it has been approved it will proceed towards the balance and can be used to purchase boards. 
• 
    ◦ Winning sums do not go towards the balance: Prize money is handled by the admins separately. 
• Some players will play digitally (your app) while others play physically. They participate in the same “round”, meaning your app simply must keep track of the digital participants.  
• 
    ◦ When the administrators figure out how much prize money to pay each winner, they calculate this manually by adding in the physical participants. Your application should therefore not calculate total prize for each winner. 
• The administrator should be able to get a clear overview of data in the application with everything being timestamped: 
• 
    ◦ The admin requires full CRUD on players  
• 
    ◦ 
        ▪ The player is registered by the admin with full name, phone number and email address. 
• 
    ◦ 
        ▪ The player can be marked as active or inactive by the Admin. Only active players may buy boards / participate in games. By default a player is inactive. 
• 
    ◦ Games (the weekly occurrence)
• 
    ◦ 
        ▪ Overview should show the history for all games. This includes: 
• 
    ◦ 
        ▪ What boards each player has played + indicate whether they are winning boards. 
• 
    ◦ 
        ▪ The total number of winning boards to quickly add together with the physical boards. 
• Sequence / number ordering of guesses and winner numbers don’t matter. 
• 
    ◦ Example: someone guessing 4-1-7-2-5 while the winning numbers are 2-5-1 is still a valid win.

**By the end of the project, the group which most gracefully and production-ready fulfills the requirements (given you accept to) will put the system into production for Jerne IF.**

**Example starter app & testing walkthrough video**

Here's my boilerplate setup which you may use for inspiration for your setups. It includes authentication and all of the stuff we've worked with in programming + testing:

I'm i the process of exchanging my work laptop, so I'll record a video explaining the testing setup soon and upload. (Thank you for your patience).

**Review meetings**

You will get a chance to present your current work in progress (to get feedback and ask questions to the stakeholder).
The timetable / order of review meetings can be found below prior to the meetings. The dates can be found in the "important dates" section in this document (at the top).

**Q&A & general advice**

During the project announcement you may have some questions. If I think the questions and answers may be very valuable to others at a later point in time, I'll upload them here. I'll also add in tips for solving the exam case.

**Tip 1: State-less API.**

It might be tempting to make some automation that creates a new game every X days / using schedulers / etc. I will strongly advise

**against**

this. I recommend simply seeding "inactive" games into the database for each week the next 20 years using a loop, and then the function that "ends" a game (by publishing the winning numbers) simply makes the next week "active" as a single database transaction. This is the least failure-prone implementation i can think of.

**Tip 2: Soft-delete everything**

. You want full history of all activities, so no hard deletes that completely erase data.

**Tip 3: "Balance" is calculated**

as a sum of approved transactions minus all "board purchases" so it's always verifiable by history if a person has positive balance. That means there is no "balance column"; It is simply a product of past history!    Last modified: Monday, 17 November 2025, 12:44 PMJump to...                     Jump to...                     Announcements                     Choose Your 3 Elective Courses                     Elective Course Descriptions                     Semester Description (semestergrundlag)                     Weekly Schedules, Calendars & Rooms                     Create Your 3rd Semester Exam Project Group Here                     Course Plan 2nd Semester                     Exam Project                     Review Meeting #1 - Schedule 06-05-2025                     Review Meeting #1.5 - Schedule 15-05-2025                     Review Meeting #2 - Schedule 26-05-2025                     Self select groups - 1st year Exam                     Material from Belman                     CS 1st year exam information.pptx                     Guide for using Wiseflow                     Vejledning i brugen af Wiseflow (Danish guide)                     Kahoot Exam training questions (SCO)                     Kahoot!
