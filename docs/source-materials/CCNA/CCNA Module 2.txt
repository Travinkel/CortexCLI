## 2.0.1 Why should I take this module?

Welcome to Basic Switch and End Device Configuration!

As part of your career in networking, you might have to set up a new network or maintain and upgrade an existing one. In either case, you'll configure switches and end devices so that they are secure and perform effectively based on your requirements.

Out of the box, switches and end devices come with some general configuration. But for your particular network, switches and end devices require your specific information and instructions. In this module, you will learn how to access Cisco IOS network devices. You will learn basic configuration commands and use them to configure and verify a Cisco IOS device and an end device with an IP address.

Of course, there is much more to network administration, but none of that can happen without first configuring switches and end devices. Let's get started!

## 2.0.2 What will I learn to do in this module?

**Module Title:** Basic Switch and End Device Configuration

**Module Objective:** Implement initial settings including passwords, IP addressing, and default gateway parameters on a network switch and end devices.

# 2.1 Cisco IOS Access

## 2.1.1 Operating Systems

All end devices and network devices require an operating system (OS). As shown in the figure, the portion of the OS that interacts directly with computer hardware is known as the **kernel**. The portion that interfaces with applications and the user is known as the **shell**. The user can interact with the shell using a **command-line interface (CLI)** or a **graphical user interface (GUI)**.

**Shell** - The user interface that allows users to request specific tasks from the computer. These requests can be made either through the CLI or GUI interfaces.

**Kernel** - Communicates between the hardware and software of a computer and manages how hardware resources are used to meet software requirements.

**Hardware** - The physical part of a computer including underlying electronics.

When using a CLI, the user interacts directly with the system in a text-based environment by entering commands on the keyboard at a command prompt. The system executes the command, often providing textual output. The CLI requires very little overhead to operate. However, it does require that the user have knowledge of the underlying command structure that controls the system.

```

---

## 2.1.2 GUI

A GUI such as Windows, macOS, Linux KDE, Apple iOS, or Android allows the user to interact with the system using an environment of graphical icons, menus, and windows. The GUI is more user-friendly and requires less knowledge of the underlying command structure that controls the system. For this reason, most users rely on GUI environments.

However, GUIs may not always be able to provide all the features available with the CLI. GUIs can also fail, crash, or simply not operate as specified. For these reasons, network devices are typically accessed through a CLI. The CLI is less resource intensive and very stable when compared to a GUI.

The family of network operating systems used on many Cisco devices is called the **Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS)**. Cisco IOS is used on many Cisco routers and switches regardless of the type or size of the device. Each device router or switch type uses a different version of Cisco IOS. Other Cisco operating systems include IOS XE, IOS XR, and NX-OS.

**Note:** The operating system on home routers is usually called firmware. The most common method for configuring a home router is by using a web browser-based GUI.

---

## 2.1.3 Purpose of an OS

Network operating systems are similar to a PC operating system. Through a GUI, a PC operating system enables a user to do the following:

- Use a mouse to make selections and run programs
- Enter text and text-based commands
- View output on a monitor

A CLI-based network operating system (e.g., the Cisco IOS on a switch or router) enables a network technician to do the following:

- Use a keyboard to run CLI-based network programs
- Use a keyboard to enter text and text-based commands
- View output on a monitor

Cisco networking devices run particular versions of the Cisco IOS. The IOS version is dependent on the type of device being used and the required features. While all devices come with a default IOS and feature set, it is possible to upgrade the IOS version or feature set to obtain additional capabilities.

---

## 2.1.4 Access Methods

A switch will forward traffic by default and does not need to be explicitly configured to operate. For example, two configured hosts connected to the same new switch would be able to communicate.

Regardless of the default behavior of a new switch, all switches should be configured and secured.

**Access Methods:**

- **Console** - Physical management port for out-of-band access
- **SSH/Telnet** - In-band remote access methods
- **AUX port** (legacy) - Remote access over telephone connection using a modem

**Note:** Some devices, such as routers, may also support a legacy auxiliary port that was used to establish a CLI session remotely over a telephone connection using a modem. Similar to a console connection, the AUX port is out-of-band and does not require networking services to be configured or available.

---

## 2.1.5 Terminal Emulation Programs

There are several terminal emulation programs you can use to connect to a networking device either by a serial connection over a console port, or by an SSH/Telnet connection. These programs allow you to enhance your productivity by adjusting window sizes, changing font sizes, and changing color schemes.

**Common terminal emulation programs:**

- **PuTTY**
- **Tera Term**
- **SecureCRT**

---

# 2.2 IOS Navigation

## 2.2.1 Primary Command Modes

As a security feature, the Cisco IOS software separates management access into the following two command modes:

**User EXEC Mode** - This mode has limited capabilities but is useful for basic operations. It allows only a limited number of basic monitoring commands but does not allow the execution of any commands that might change the configuration of the device. The user EXEC mode is identified by the CLI prompt that ends with the `>` symbol.

**Privileged EXEC Mode** - To execute configuration commands, a network administrator must access privileged EXEC mode. Higher configuration modes, like global configuration mode, can only be reached from privileged EXEC mode. The privileged EXEC mode can be identified by the prompt ending with the `#` symbol.

| Mode | Prompt | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User EXEC | `Switch>` | Limited monitoring commands |
| Privileged EXEC | `Switch#` | Full device access |

---

## 2.2.2 Configuration Mode and Subconfiguration Modes

To configure the device, the user must enter **global configuration mode**, which is commonly called global config mode.

From global config mode, CLI configuration changes are made that affect the operation of the device as a whole. Global configuration mode is identified by a prompt that ends with `(config)#` after the device name, such as `Switch(config)#`.

Global configuration mode is accessed before other specific configuration modes. From global config mode, the user can enter different subconfiguration modes. Each of these modes allows the configuration of a particular part or function of the IOS device. Two common subconfiguration modes include:

**Line Configuration Mode** - Used to configure console, SSH, Telnet, or AUX access. Prompt: `Switch(config-line)#`

**Interface Configuration Mode** - Used to configure a switch port or router network interface. Prompt: `Switch(config-if)#`

---

## 2.2.4 Navigate Between IOS Modes

Various commands are used to move in and out of command prompts. To move from user EXEC mode to privileged EXEC mode, use the `enable` command. Use the `disable` privileged EXEC mode command to return to user EXEC mode.

**Note:** Privileged EXEC mode is sometimes called enable mode.

To move in and out of global configuration mode, use the `configure terminal` privileged EXEC mode command. To return to the privileged EXEC mode, enter the `exit` global config mode command.

**Line subconfiguration mode:**

```
Switch(config)# line console 0
Switch(config-line)# exit
Switch(config)#
```

To move from any subconfiguration mode to the privileged EXEC mode, enter the `end` command or enter the key combination **Ctrl+Z**.

```
Switch(config-line)# end
Switch#
```

You can also move directly from one subconfiguration mode to another:

```
Switch(config-line)# interface FastEthernet 0/1
Switch(config-if)#
```

---

# 2.3 The Command Structure

## 2.3.1 Basic IOS Command Structure

A Cisco IOS device supports many commands. Each IOS command has a specific format, or syntax, and can only be executed in the appropriate mode. The general syntax for a command is the command followed by any appropriate keywords and arguments.

**General syntax:**

```
Prompt Command [keyword | argument]
```

**Examples:**

```
Switch> show ip protocols
Switch> ping 192.168.10.5
```

- **Keyword** - This is a specific parameter defined in the operating system (e.g., `ip protocols`)
- **Argument** - This is not predefined; it is a value or variable defined by the user (e.g., `192.168.10.5`)

After entering each complete command, including any keywords and arguments, press the **Enter** key to submit the command to the command interpreter.

---

## 2.3.2 IOS Command Syntax Check

A command might require one or more arguments. To determine the keywords and arguments required for a command, refer to the command syntax. The syntax provides the pattern, or format, that must be used when entering a command.

**Syntax conventions:**

- **Boldface text** - Commands and keywords entered as shown
- **Italic text** - Arguments for which the user provides the value

**Examples:**

- `ping ip-address` - The command is `ping` and the user-defined argument is the ip-address of the destination device. For example, `ping 10.10.10.5`.
- `traceroute ip-address` - The command is `traceroute` and the user-defined argument is the ip-address of the destination device. For example, `traceroute 192.168.254.254`.

If a command is complex with multiple arguments, you may see it represented like this:

```
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security aging { static | time time | type {absolute | inactivity}
```

The Cisco IOS Command Reference is the ultimate source of information for a particular IOS command.

---

## 2.3.3 IOS Help Features

The IOS has two forms of help available: **context-sensitive help** and **command syntax check**.

**Context-sensitive help** enables you to quickly find answers to these questions:

- Which commands are available in each command mode?
- Which commands start with specific characters or group of characters?
- Which arguments and keywords are available to particular commands?

To access context-sensitive help, simply enter a question mark, `?`, at the CLI.

**Command syntax check** verifies that a valid command was entered by the user. When a command is entered, the command line interpreter evaluates the command from left to right. If the interpreter understands the command, the requested action is executed, and the CLI returns to the appropriate prompt. However, if the interpreter cannot understand the command being entered, it will provide feedback describing what is wrong with the command.

---

## 2.3.5 Hot Keys and Shortcuts

The IOS CLI provides hot keys and shortcuts that make configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting easier.

Commands and keywords can be shortened to the minimum number of characters that identify a unique selection. For example, the `configure` command can be shortened to `conf` because configure is the only command that begins with conf. An even shorter version, `con`, will not work because more than one command begins with con. Keywords can also be shortened.

**Common keyboard shortcuts:**

| Key | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Tab | Completes partial command |
| Ctrl+A | Moves to beginning of line |
| Ctrl+E | Moves to end of line |
| Ctrl+R | Redisplays line |
| Ctrl+Z | Exits configuration mode |
| Ctrl+C | Aborts current command |
| Ctrl+Shift+6 | All-purpose break sequence |

**"--More--" prompt controls:**

| Key | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Enter | Displays next line |
| Space | Displays next screen |
| Any other key | Ends display string |

**Note:** While the Delete key typically deletes the character to the right of the prompt, the IOS command structure does not recognize the Delete key.

---

# 2.4 Basic Device Configuration

## 2.4.1 Device Names

The first configuration command on any device should be to give it a unique device name or hostname. By default, all devices are assigned a factory default name. For example, a Cisco IOS switch is "Switch."

The problem is if all switches in a network were left with their default names, it would be difficult to identify a specific device. For instance, how would you know that you are connected to the right device when accessing it remotely using SSH? The hostname provides confirmation that you are connected to the correct device.

The default name should be changed to something more descriptive. By choosing names wisely, it is easier to remember, document, and identify network devices. Here are some important naming guidelines for hosts:

- Start with a letter
- Contain no spaces
- End with a letter or digit
- Use only letters, digits, and dashes
- Be less than 64 characters in length

An organization must choose a naming convention that makes it easy and intuitive to identify a specific device.

**Configuration example:**

```
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# hostname Sw-Floor-1
Sw-Floor-1(config)#
```

**Note:** To return the switch to the default prompt, use the `no hostname` global config command.

Always make sure the documentation is updated each time a device is added or modified. Identify devices in the documentation by their location, purpose, and address.

---

## 2.4.2 Password Guidelines

The use of weak or easily guessed passwords continues to be the biggest security concern of organizations. Network devices, including home wireless routers, should always have passwords configured to limit administrative access.

Cisco IOS can be configured to use hierarchical mode passwords to allow different access privileges to a network device.

All networking devices should limit administrative access by securing privileged EXEC, user EXEC, and remote Telnet access with passwords. In addition, all passwords should be encrypted and legal notifications provided.

When choosing passwords, use strong passwords that are not easily guessed. There are some key points to consider when choosing passwords:

- Use passwords that are more than eight characters in length.
- Use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and/or numeric sequences.
- Avoid using the same password for all devices.
- Do not use common words because they are easily guessed.

**Note:** Most of the labs in this course use simple passwords such as cisco or class. These passwords are considered weak and easily guessable and should be avoided in production environments. We only use these passwords for convenience in a classroom setting, or to illustrate configuration examples.

---

## 2.4.3 Configure Passwords

**Console password configuration:**

```
Sw-Floor-1# configure terminal
Sw-Floor-1(config)# line console 0
Sw-Floor-1(config-line)# password cisco
Sw-Floor-1(config-line)# login
Sw-Floor-1(config-line)# end
Sw-Floor-1#
```

Console access will now require a password before allowing access to the user EXEC mode.

**Privileged EXEC password configuration:**

```
Sw-Floor-1# configure terminal
Sw-Floor-1(config)# enable secret class
Sw-Floor-1(config)# exit
Sw-Floor-1#
```

**VTY lines password configuration:**

Virtual terminal (VTY) lines enable remote access using Telnet or SSH to the device. Many Cisco switches support up to 16 VTY lines that are numbered 0 to 15.

```
Sw-Floor-1# configure terminal
Sw-Floor-1(config)# line vty 0 15
Sw-Floor-1(config-line)# password cisco
Sw-Floor-1(config-line)# login
Sw-Floor-1(config-line)# end
Sw-Floor-1#
```

---

## 2.4.4 Encrypt Passwords

The startup-config and running-config files display most passwords in plaintext. This is a security threat because anyone can discover the passwords if they have access to these files.

To encrypt all plaintext passwords, use the `service password-encryption` global config command:

```
Sw-Floor-1# configure terminal
Sw-Floor-1(config)# service password-encryption
Sw-Floor-1(config)#
```

The command applies weak encryption to all unencrypted passwords. This encryption applies only to passwords in the configuration file, not to passwords as they are sent over the network. The purpose of this command is to keep unauthorized individuals from viewing passwords in the configuration file.

Use the `show running-config` command to verify that passwords are now encrypted:

```
Sw-Floor-1(config)# end
Sw-Floor-1# show running-config
!
(Output omitted)
!
line con 0
 password 7 094F471A1A0A
 login
!
line vty 0 4
 password 7 094F471A1A0A
 login
line vty 5 15
 password 7 094F471A1A0A
 login
!
!
end
```

---

## 2.4.5 Banner Messages

Although requiring passwords is one way to keep unauthorized personnel out of a network, it is vital to provide a method for declaring that only authorized personnel should attempt to access the device. To do this, add a banner to the device output. Banners can be an important part of the legal process in the event that someone is prosecuted for breaking into a device. Some legal systems do not allow prosecution, or even the monitoring of users, unless a notification is visible.

To create a banner message of the day on a network device, use the `banner motd # the message of the day #` global config command. The "#" in the command syntax is called the delimiting character. It is entered before and after the message. The delimiting character can be any character as long as it does not occur in the message. For this reason, symbols such as the "#" are often used. After the command is executed, the banner will be displayed on all subsequent attempts to access the device until the banner is removed.

**Example:**

```
Sw-Floor-1# configure terminal
Sw-Floor-1(config)# banner motd #Authorized Access Only#
```

---

# 2.5 Save Configurations

## 2.5.1 Configuration Files

There are two system files that store the device configuration:

**startup-config** - This is the saved configuration file that is stored in NVRAM. It contains all the commands that will be used by the device upon startup or reboot. Flash does not lose its contents when the device is powered off.

**running-config** - This is stored in Random Access Memory (RAM). It reflects the current configuration. Modifying a running configuration affects the operation of a Cisco device immediately. RAM is volatile memory. It loses all of its content when the device is powered off or restarted.

The `show running-config` privileged EXEC mode command is used to view the running config:

```
Sw-Floor-1# show running-config
Building configuration...
Current configuration : 1351 bytes
!
! Last configuration change at 00:01:20 UTC Mon Mar 1 1993
!
version 15.0
no service pad
service timestamps debug datetime msec
service timestamps log datetime msec
service password-encryption
!
hostname Sw-Floor-1
!
(output omitted)
```

To view the startup configuration file, use the `show startup-config` privileged EXEC command.

If power to the device is lost, or if the device is restarted, all configuration changes will be lost unless they have been saved. To save changes made to the running configuration to the startup configuration file, use the `copy running-config startup-config` privileged EXEC mode command.

---

## 2.5.2 Alter the Running Configuration

If changes made to the running config do not have the desired effect and the running-config has not yet been saved, you can restore the device to its previous configuration. Remove the changed commands individually, or reload the device using the `reload` privileged EXEC mode command to restore the startup-config.

The downside to using the reload command to remove an unsaved running config is the brief amount of time the device will be offline, causing network downtime.

When a reload is initiated, the IOS will detect that the running config has changes that were not saved to the startup configuration. A prompt will appear to ask whether to save the changes. To discard the changes, enter **n** or **no**.

Alternatively, if undesired changes were saved to the startup config, it may be necessary to clear all the configurations. This requires erasing the startup config and restarting the device. The startup config is removed by using the `erase startup-config` privileged EXEC mode command. After the command is issued, the switch will prompt you for confirmation. Press **Enter** to accept.

After removing the startup config from NVRAM, reload the device to remove the current running config file from RAM. On reload, a switch will load the default startup config that originally shipped with the device.

---

## 2.5.4 Capture Configuration to a Text File

Configuration files can also be saved and archived to a text document. This sequence of steps ensures that a working copy of the configuration file is available for editing or reuse later.

For example, assume that a switch has been configured, and the running config has been saved on the device.

**Step 1.** Open terminal emulation software, such as PuTTY or Tera Term, that is already connected to a switch.

**Step 2.** Enable logging in the terminal software and assign a name and file location to save the log file. All session output will be captured to the file specified.

**Step 3.** Execute the `show running-config` or `show startup-config` command at the privileged EXEC prompt. Text displayed in the terminal window will be placed into the chosen file.

```
Sw-Floor-1# show running-config
Building configuration...
(output omitted)
```

**Step 4.** Disable logging in the terminal software.

The text file created can be used as a record of how the device is currently implemented. The file could require editing before being used to restore a saved configuration to a device.

**To restore a configuration file to a device:**

**Step 1.** Enter global configuration mode on the device.

**Step 2.** Copy and paste the text file into the terminal window connected to the switch.

The text in the file will be applied as commands in the CLI and become the running configuration on the device. This is a convenient method of manually configuring a device.

# 2.6 Ports and Addresses

## 2.6.1 IP Addresses

The use of IP addresses is the primary means of enabling devices to locate one another and establish end-to-end communication on the internet. Each end device on a network must be configured with an IP address. Examples of end devices include:

- Computers (work stations, laptops, file servers, web servers)
- Network printers
- VoIP phones
- Security cameras
- Smart phones
- Mobile handheld devices (such as wireless barcode scanners)

The structure of an IPv4 address is called **dotted decimal notation** and is represented by four decimal numbers between 0 and 255. IPv4 addresses are assigned to individual devices connected to a network.

**Note:** IP in this course refers to both the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. IPv6 is the most recent version of IP and is replacing the more common IPv4.

With the IPv4 address, a **subnet mask** is also necessary. An IPv4 subnet mask is a 32-bit value that differentiates the network portion of the address from the host portion. Coupled with the IPv4 address, the subnet mask determines to which subnet the device is a member.

The **default gateway** address is the IP address of the router that the host will use to access remote networks, including the internet.

**IPv6 addresses** are 128 bits in length and written as a string of hexadecimal values. Every four bits is represented by a single hexadecimal digit; for a total of 32 hexadecimal values. Groups of four hexadecimal digits are separated by a colon (:). IPv6 addresses are not case-sensitive and can be written in either lowercase or uppercase.

---

## 2.6.2 Interfaces and Ports

Network communications depend on end user device interfaces, networking device interfaces, and the cables that connect them. Each physical interface has specifications, or standards, that define it. A cable connecting to the interface must be designed to match the physical standards of the interface. Types of network media include:

- **Twisted-pair copper cables**
- **Fiber-optic cables**
- **Coaxial cables**
- **Wireless**

Different types of network media have different features and benefits. Not all network media have the same characteristics. These are some of the differences between various types of media:

- Distance the media can successfully carry a signal
- Environment in which the media is to be installed
- Amount of data and the speed at which it must be transmitted
- Cost of the media and installation

Not only does each link on the internet require a specific network media type, but each link also requires a particular network technology. For example, **Ethernet** is the most common local-area network (LAN) technology used today. Ethernet ports are found on end-user devices, switch devices, and other networking devices that can physically connect to the network using a cable.

Cisco IOS Layer 2 switches have physical ports for devices to connect. These ports do not support Layer 3 IP addresses. Therefore, switches have one or more **switch virtual interfaces (SVIs)**. These are virtual interfaces because there is no physical hardware on the device associated with it. An SVI is created in software.

The virtual interface lets you remotely manage a switch over a network using IPv4 and IPv6. Each switch comes with one SVI appearing in the default configuration "out-of-the-box." The default SVI is interface VLAN1.

**Note:** A Layer 2 switch does not need an IP address. The IP address assigned to the SVI is used to remotely access the switch. An IP address is not necessary for the switch to perform its operations.

---

# 2.7 Configure IP Addressing

## 2.7.1 Manual IP Address Configuration for End Devices

IPv4 address information can be entered into end devices manually, or automatically using **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**.

To manually configure an IPv4 address on a Windows host, open the **Control Panel > Network Sharing Center > Change adapter settings** and choose the adapter. Next right-click and select **Properties** to display the Local Area Connection Properties.

Highlight **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click **Properties** to open the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties window. Configure the IPv4 address and subnet mask information, and default gateway.

**Note:** IPv6 addressing and configuration options are similar to IPv4.

**Note:** The DNS server addresses are the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the Domain Name System (DNS) servers, which are used to translate IP addresses to domain names, such as [www.cisco.com](http://www.cisco.com).

---

## 2.7.2 Automatic IP Address Configuration for End Devices

End devices typically default to using DHCP for automatic IPv4 address configuration. DHCP is a technology that is used in almost every network. The best way to understand why DHCP is so popular is by considering all the extra work that would have to take place without it.

In a network, DHCP enables automatic IPv4 address configuration for every end device that is DHCP-enabled. Imagine the amount of time it would take if every time you connected to the network, you had to manually enter the IPv4 address, the subnet mask, the default gateway, and the DNS server. Multiply that by every user and every device in an organization and you see the problem. Manual configuration also increases the chance of misconfiguration by duplicating another device's IPv4 address.

To configure DHCP on a Windows PC, you only need to select **Obtain an IP address automatically** and **Obtain DNS server address automatically**. Your PC will search out a DHCP server and be assigned the address settings necessary to communicate on the network.

**Note:** IPv6 uses DHCPv6 and SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration) for dynamic address allocation.

---

## 2.7.4 Switch Virtual Interface Configuration

To access the switch remotely, an IP address and a subnet mask must be configured on the SVI. To configure an SVI on a switch, use the `interface vlan 1` global configuration command. Vlan 1 is not an actual physical interface but a virtual one. Next assign an IPv4 address using the `ip address ip-address subnet-mask` interface configuration command. Finally, enable the virtual interface using the `no shutdown` interface configuration command.

After these commands are configured, the switch has all the IPv4 elements ready for communication over the network.

**Note:** Similar to a Windows hosts, switches configured with an IPv4 address will typically also need to have a default gateway assigned. This can be done using the `ip default-gateway ip-address` global configuration command. The ip-address parameter would be the IPv4 address of the local router on the network. However, in this module you will only be configuring a network with switches and hosts. Routers will be introduced later.

**Configuration example:**

```
Sw-Floor-1# configure terminal
Sw-Floor-1(config)# interface vlan 1
Sw-Floor-1(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.20 255.255.255.0
Sw-Floor-1(config-if)# no shutdown
Sw-Floor-1(config-if)# exit
Sw-Floor-1(config)# ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1
```

---

# 2.8 Verify Connectivity

## 2.8.1 Test the Interface Assignment

In the same way that you use commands and utilities like `ipconfig` to verify the network configuration of a PC host, you also use commands to verify the interfaces and address settings of intermediary devices like switches and routers.

The `show ip interface brief` command is useful for verifying the condition of the switch interfaces. This command displays:

- Interface name
- IP address
- Status (up/down)
- Protocol status

**Windows PC command:**

```
C:\> ipconfig
```

Displays the IP configuration of the Windows host including:

- IPv4 address
- Subnet mask
- Default gateway

**Switch command:**

```
Switch# show ip interface brief
```

Displays the status and IP configuration of all switch interfaces.

---

## 2.8.2 Test End-to-End Connectivity

The `ping` command can be used to test connectivity to another device on the network or a website on the internet.

The ping command sends out a request to a specified IP address. When a host receives a ping message, it responds with a ping reply. The ping command calculates elapsed time and determines whether all packets were successfully received.

**Usage examples:**

```
Switch# ping 192.168.1.1
```

Tests connectivity to the default gateway.

```
C:\> ping 192.168.1.20
```

Tests connectivity from a Windows PC to a switch.

**Ping success indicators:**

- `!` = successful reply
- `.` = timeout waiting for reply
- `U` = destination unreachable
