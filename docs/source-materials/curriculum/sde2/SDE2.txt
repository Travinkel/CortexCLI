You have to work on your own as I'm unable to attend classes.

Recommendations for using branches
Git under the hood

Branching strategies and workflows
- Git flow
- GitHub flow
- GitLab Flow

Common git commands + cheat sheet: https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf


Workshop
- GitHub Minesweeper
For the reminder of the time you are going to play Minesweeper... using Git.
The way you play is designed to help you build muscle memory of the most common git commands you will be using.
The workflow you will be practicing they call it trunk-based development, but effectively it is the same as GitHub Flow.

- Read this great article about Continuous Integration: https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration

Remember the career fair at Blue Water Dokken. It's a fair where you can meet both small and large companies from Esbjerg.
You'll have the chance to explore potential student jobs or start looking for internships.
You can register for free here:https://www.businessesbjerg.com/da/arrangementer/karrieremesse-esbjerg-2025



From next week and until course end, Patrick will take over.
It has been a pleasure conducting classes with you :)







W40: Linting & Formatting
About this week

This lecture will cover linting and formatting. Specifically we'll work with ESLint for TypeScript. The point of this lecture is for you to understand how you can use linters and formatters to improve the quality of your code.

During the lecture you'll learn about:

What is linting?
What does linting "fix"?
How can you improve code quality using linting

Learning resources


Read: Linters aren't in your way. They're on your side

Prepare: Setting up Node

Prepare: Clone the repository

Prepare: Set up ESLint

Presentation

Learning activities


Assignments
Task 01: Configure ESLint

Task 02: Automate Formatting

Task 03: Linting Rules

Task 04: Custom Linting Rules

Solution
Custom ESLint Rule

W41: Code Generation & Scaffolding
About this week

This lecture is about code generation and how you can use it to simplify the development process while maintaining quality and consistency across your codebase.

And why should you use code generation?

Time saved through automation


Learning resources


Read: Using Generators to Improve Developer Productivity

Read: Improve Developer Productivity with Generators and Team Conventions

Presentation

Learning activities

The setup
You'll be working on the codebase from last week. The linting assignments are not a prerequisite for doing this assignment.

If you want to start from scratch, you can clone the repository from last week:

git clone https://github.com/patrickstolc/sd2-linting-formatting

Task 01: Installing Plop.js

Task 02: Configure Plop.js

Task 03: Generators

Task 04: Templates

Task 05: Using a Generator

Task 06: Component Generator

Solution: Component Generator

W42: Autumn holiday
W43: Git Hooks
About this week

This lecture is about Git hooks. You'll learn about the different events triggered by Git and how you can tap into them to enforce code quality and security checks before the code leaves the developer's machine.


Learning resources


Read: Git Hooks

Read: ESLint, Prettier, Husky & lint-staged

Learning activities

The setup
You'll continue work on the same codebase as the previous two lectures. The completion of the previous lectures exercises are not a prerequisite for working on this lectures exercises.

If you want to start from scratch, you can clone the repository from last week:

git clone https://github.com/patrickstolc/sd2-linting-formatting

Docs: Git Hooks

Docs: Husky

Docs: lint-staged

Docs: Conventional Commits

Task 01: Install Husky

Task 05: Pre-push - typecheck and tests

Task 06: Secretlint

Presentation

W44: Environments & Configuration Management
About this week

This week we’re shifting from “how code looks” to how code behaves across environments.

We’ll learn to build for multiple environments using a single codebase, leveraging configurations and environment variables to change how the application behaves - without touching the code.

You’ll see how development, preview/staging, and production differ only by data, not code, and how small guardrails (typing, validation, .env.example, CI variables) help prevent deployment of applications that will eventually fail.


Learning resources


Read: Env Variables and Modes

Read: The Twelve-Factor App: Config

Docs: Zod

Repo: Starter Code

Presentation

W45: Smoke & Sanity Testing
About this week

This week you are going to work on adding smoke and sanity tests to the room-booking application.

Adding these types of tests will help you to catch critical bugs before the code reaches production. These tests differ from unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests by not testing the code or the functionality, but rather the build and the application itself.
