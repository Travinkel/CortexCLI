## 1.2 Network Components

### 1.2.1 Host Roles

All computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communication are classified as **hosts**. Hosts can be called end devices. Some hosts are also called clients. However, the term hosts specifically refers to devices on the network that are assigned a number for communication purposes. This number is called the **Internet Protocol (IP) address**. An IP address identifies the host and the network to which the host is attached.

**Servers** are computers with software that allow them to provide information, like email or web pages, to other end devices on the network. Each service requires separate server software. For example, a server requires web server software in order to provide web services to the network. A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously to many different clients.

**Common server types:**

| Server Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Email | Email server runs email server software. Clients use client software to access email |
| Web | Web server runs web server software. Clients use browser software to access web pages |
| File | File server stores corporate and user files. The client devices access these files |

**Clients** are a type of host. Clients have software for requesting and displaying the information obtained from the server. An example of client software is a web browser, like Chrome or Firefox. A single computer can also run multiple types of client software. For example, a user can check email and view a web page while instant messaging and listening to an audio stream.

### 1.2.2 Peer-to-Peer

Client and server software usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to be used for both roles at the same time. In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a **peer-to-peer network**.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Easy to set up | No centralized administration |
| Less complex | Not as secure |
| Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required | Not scalable |
| Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers | All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance |

### 1.2.3 End Devices

The network devices that people are most familiar with are **end devices**. To distinguish one end device from another, each end device on a network has an address. When an end device initiates communication, it uses the address of the destination end device to specify where to deliver the message.

An end device is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network. Data originates with an end device, flows through the network, and arrives at an end device.

**Examples of end devices:**

- Computers (workstations, laptops, file servers, web servers)
- Network printers
- VoIP phones
- Security cameras
- Smart phones
- Mobile handheld devices (such as wireless barcode scanners)

### 1.2.4 Intermediary Devices

**Intermediary devices** connect the individual end devices to the network. They can connect multiple individual networks to form an internetwork. These intermediary devices provide connectivity and ensure that data flows across the network.

Intermediary devices use the destination end device address, in conjunction with information about the network interconnections, to determine the path that messages should take through the network.

**Common intermediary devices:**

- Wireless Router
- LAN Switch
- Router
- Multilayer Switch
- Firewall Appliance

**Intermediary network devices perform some or all of these functions:**

- Regenerate and retransmit communication signals
- Maintain information about what pathways exist through the network and internetwork
- Notify other devices of errors and communication failures
- Direct data along alternate pathways when there is a link failure
- Classify and direct messages according to priorities
- Permit or deny the flow of data, based on security settings

> **Note:** Not shown is a legacy Ethernet hub. An Ethernet hub is also known as a multiport repeater. Repeaters regenerate and retransmit communication signals. Notice that all intermediary devices perform the function of a repeater.
> 

### 1.2.5 Network Media

Communication transmits across a network on **media**. The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.

**Modern networks primarily use three types of media:**

1. **Metal wires within cables (Copper)** — Data is encoded into electrical impulses
2. **Glass or plastic fibers within cables (Fiber-optic)** — Data is encoded into pulses of light
3. **Wireless transmission** — Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves

**The four main criteria for choosing network media:**

- What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a signal?
- What is the environment in which the media will be installed?
- What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted?
- What is the cost of the media and installation?

## 1.4 Common Types of Networks

### 1.4.1 Networks of Many Sizes

Networks come in all sizes. They range from simple networks consisting of two computers, to networks connecting millions of devices.

- **Simple home networks** let you share resources, such as printers, documents, pictures, and music, among a few local end devices
- **Small office and home office (SOHO) networks** allow people to work from home, or a remote office. Many self-employed workers use these types of networks to advertise and sell products, order supplies, and communicate with customers
- **Businesses and large organizations** use networks to provide consolidation, storage, and access to information on network servers. Networks provide email, instant messaging, and collaboration among employees
- **The internet** is the largest network in existence. In fact, the term internet means a "network of networks". It is a collection of interconnected private and public networks

### 1.4.2 LANs and WANs

Network infrastructures vary greatly in terms of:

- Size of the area covered
- Number of users connected
- Number and types of services available
- Area of responsibility

The two most common types of network infrastructures are **Local Area Networks (LANs)** and **Wide Area Networks (WANs)**.

### Local Area Networks (LANs)

A LAN is a network infrastructure that provides access to users and end devices in a small geographical area. LANs have specific characteristics:

- LANs interconnect end devices in a limited area such as a home, school, office building, or campus
- A LAN is usually administered by a single organization or individual. Administrative control is enforced at the network level and governs the security and access control policies
- LANs provide high-speed bandwidth to internal end devices and intermediary devices

### Wide Area Networks (WANs)

A WAN is a network infrastructure that spans a wide geographical area. WANs are typically managed by service providers (SPs) or Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

WANs have specific characteristics:

- WANs interconnect LANs over wide geographical areas such as between cities, states, provinces, countries, or continents
- WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers
- WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs

### 1.4.3 The Internet

The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internetworks, or internet for short). Some of the LAN examples are connected to each other through a WAN connection. WANs are then connected to each other. WANs can connect through copper wires, fiber-optic cables, and wireless transmissions.

The internet is not owned by any individual or group. Ensuring effective communication across this diverse infrastructure requires the application of consistent and commonly recognized technologies and standards as well as the cooperation of many network administration agencies. These organizations include:

- **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**
- **Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)**
- **Internet Architecture Board (IAB)**

### 1.4.4 Intranets and Extranets

**Intranet** is a term often used to refer to a private connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organization. An intranet is designed to be accessible only by the organization's members, employees, or others with authorization.

An organization may use an **extranet** to provide secure and safe access to individuals who work for a different organization but require access to the organization's data.

**Examples of extranets:**

- A company that is providing access to outside suppliers and contractors
- A hospital that is providing a booking system to doctors so they can make appointments for their patients
- A local office of education that is providing budget and personnel information to the schools in its district

## 1.5 Internet Connections

### 1.5.1 Internet Access Technologies

Home users, remote workers, and small offices typically require a connection to an ISP to access the internet. Connection options vary greatly between ISPs and geographical locations. However, popular choices include broadband cable, broadband digital subscriber line (DSL), wireless WANs, and mobile services.

Organizations usually need access to other corporate sites as well as the internet. Fast connections are required to support business services including IP phones, video conferencing, and data center storage. SPs offer business-class interconnections. Popular business-class services include business DSL, leased lines, and Metro Ethernet.

### 1.5.2 Home and Small Office Internet Connections

**Cable** — Typically offered by cable television service providers, the internet data signal transmits on the same cable that delivers cable television. It provides a high bandwidth, high availability, and an always-on connection to the internet.

**DSL (Digital Subscriber Lines)** — Also provides high bandwidth, high availability, and an always-on connection to the internet. DSL runs over a telephone line. In general, small office and home office users connect using Asymmetrical DSL (ADSL), which means that the download speed is faster than the upload speed.

**Cellular** — Cellular internet access uses a cell phone network to connect. Wherever you can get a cellular signal, you can get cellular internet access. Performance is limited by the capabilities of the phone and the cell tower to which it is connected.

**Satellite** — The availability of satellite internet access is a benefit in those areas that would otherwise have no internet connectivity at all. Satellite dishes require a clear line of sight to the satellite.

**Dial-up Telephone** — An inexpensive option that uses any phone line and a modem. The low bandwidth provided by a dial-up modem connection is not sufficient for large data transfer, although it is useful for mobile access while traveling.

### 1.5.3 Business Internet Connections

**Dedicated Leased Line** — Leased lines are reserved circuits within the service provider's network that connect geographically separated offices for private voice and/or data networking. The circuits are rented at a monthly or yearly rate.

**Metro Ethernet** — This is sometimes known as Ethernet WAN. Metro ethernets extend LAN access technology into the WAN. Ethernet is a LAN technology.

**Business DSL** — Business DSL is available in various formats. A popular choice is Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL) which is similar to the consumer version of DSL but provides uploads and downloads at the same high speeds.

**Satellite** — Satellite service can provide a connection when a wired solution is not available.

### 1.5.4 The Converging Network

### Traditional Separate Networks

Consider a school built thirty years ago. Back then, some classrooms were cabled for the data network, telephone network, and video network for televisions. These separate networks could not communicate with each other. Each network used different technologies to carry the communication signal. Each network had its own set of rules and standards to ensure successful communication. Multiple services ran on multiple networks.

### Converged Networks

Today, the separate data, telephone, and video networks converge. Unlike dedicated networks, **converged networks** are capable of delivering data, voice, and video between many different types of devices over the same network infrastructure. This network infrastructure uses the same set of rules, agreements, and implementation standards. Converged data networks carry multiple services on one network.

## 1.6 Reliable Networks

### 1.6.1 Network Architecture

The term **network architecture**, in this context, refers to the technologies that support the infrastructure and the programmed services and rules, or protocols, that move data across the network.

As networks evolve, we have learned that there are **four basic characteristics that network architects must address** to meet user expectations:

1. **Fault Tolerance**
2. **Scalability**
3. **Quality of Service (QoS)**
4. **Security**

### 1.6.2 Fault Tolerance

A **fault tolerant network** is one that limits the number of affected devices during a failure. It is built to allow quick recovery when such a failure occurs. These networks depend on multiple paths between the source and destination of a message. If one path fails, the messages are instantly sent over a different link. Having multiple paths to a destination is known as **redundancy**.

Implementing a **packet-switched network** is one way that reliable networks provide redundancy. Packet switching splits traffic into packets that are routed over a shared network. A single message, such as an email or a video stream, is broken into multiple message blocks, called **packets**. Each packet has the necessary addressing information of the source and destination of the message. The routers within the network switch the packets based on the condition of the network at that moment. This means that all the packets in a single message could take very different paths to the same destination.

> **Key Insight:** Redundant connections allow for alternative paths if a device or a link fails. The user experience is unaffected.
> 

### 1.6.3 Scalability

A **scalable network** expands quickly to support new users and applications. It does this without degrading the performance of services that are being accessed by existing users. These networks are scalable because the designers follow accepted standards and protocols. This lets software and hardware vendors focus on improving products and services without having to design a new set of rules for operating within the network.

### 1.6.4 Quality of Service (QoS)

**Quality of Service (QoS)** is an increasing requirement of networks today. New applications available to users over networks, such as voice and live video transmissions, create higher expectations for the quality of the delivered services. Have you ever tried to watch a video with constant breaks and pauses? As data, voice, and video content continue to converge onto the same network, QoS becomes a primary mechanism for managing congestion and ensuring reliable delivery of content to all users.

**Congestion** occurs when the demand for bandwidth exceeds the amount available. Network bandwidth is measured in the number of bits that can be transmitted in a single second, or **bits per second (bps)**. When simultaneous communications are attempted across the network, the demand for network bandwidth can exceed its availability, creating network congestion.

When the volume of traffic is greater than what can be transported across the network, devices will hold the packets in memory until resources become available to transmit them. With a QoS policy in place, the router can manage the flow of data and voice traffic, giving priority to voice communications if the network experiences congestion.

> **The focus of QoS** is to prioritize time-sensitive traffic. The type of traffic, not the content of the traffic, is what is important.
> 

### 1.6.5 Network Security

The network infrastructure, services, and the data contained on network-attached devices are crucial personal and business assets. Network administrators must address two types of network security concerns: **network infrastructure security** and **information security**.

Securing the network infrastructure includes physically securing devices that provide network connectivity and preventing unauthorized access to the management software that resides on them.

Network administrators must also protect the information contained within the packets being transmitted over the network, and the information stored on network attached devices.

**Three primary requirements for network security:**

1. **Confidentiality** — Data confidentiality means that only the intended and authorized recipients can access and read data
2. **Integrity** — Data integrity assures users that the information has not been altered in transmission, from origin to destination
3. **Availability** — Data availability assures users of timely and reliable access to data services for authorized users

## 1.7 Network Trends

### 1.7.1 Recent Trends

As new technologies and end-user devices come to market, businesses and consumers must continue to adjust to this ever-changing environment. There are several networking trends that affect organizations and consumers:

- **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**
- **Online collaboration**
- **Video communications**
- **Cloud Computing**

### 1.7.2 Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)

The concept of any device, for any content, in any manner, is a major global trend that requires significant changes to the way we use devices and safely connect them to networks. This is called **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**.

BYOD enables end users the freedom to use personal tools to access information and communicate across a business or campus network. With the growth of consumer devices, and the related drop in cost, employees and students may have advanced computing and networking devices for personal use. These include laptops, notebooks, tablets, smart phones, and e-readers. These may be purchased by the company or school, purchased by the individual, or both.

**BYOD means any device, with any ownership, used anywhere.**

### 1.7.3 Online Collaboration

Individuals want to connect to the network, not only for access to data applications, but also to collaborate with one another. **Collaboration** is defined as "the act of working with another or others on a joint project." Collaboration tools, like Cisco WebEx, give employees, students, teachers, customers, and partners a way to instantly connect, interact, and achieve their objectives.

Collaboration is a critical and strategic priority that organizations are using to remain competitive. Collaboration is also a priority in education. Students need to collaborate to assist each other in learning, to develop the team skills used in the workforce, and to work together on team-based projects.

### 1.7.4 Video Communications

Another facet of networking that is critical to the communication and collaboration effort is video. Video is used for communications, collaboration, and entertainment. Video calls are made to and from anyone with an internet connection, regardless of where they are located.

Video conferencing is a powerful tool for communicating with others, both locally and globally. Video is becoming a critical requirement for effective collaboration as organizations extend across geographic and cultural boundaries.

### 1.7.6 Cloud Computing

**Cloud computing** is one of the ways that we access and store data. Cloud computing allows us to store personal files, even backup an entire drive on servers over the internet. Applications such as word processing and photo editing can be accessed using the cloud.

For businesses, Cloud computing extends the capabilities of IT without requiring investment in new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software. These services are available on-demand and delivered economically to any device that is anywhere in the world without compromising security or function.

Cloud computing is possible because of **data centers**. Data centers are facilities used to house computer systems and associated components. A data center can occupy one room of a building, one or more floors, or an entire warehouse-sized building. Data centers are typically very expensive to build and maintain. For this reason, only large organizations use privately built data centers to house their data and provide services to users. Smaller organizations that cannot afford to maintain their own private data center can reduce the overall cost of ownership by leasing server and storage services from a larger data center organization in the cloud.

For security, reliability, and fault tolerance, cloud providers often store data in distributed data centers. Instead of storing all the data of a person or an organization in one data center, it is stored in multiple data centers in different locations.

**Four primary types of clouds:**

- **Public clouds**
- **Private clouds**
- **Hybrid clouds**
- **Community clouds**

### 1.7.7 Technology Trends in the Home

Networking trends are not only affecting the way we communicate at work and at school, but also changing many aspects of the home. The newest home trends include **smart home technology**.

Smart home technology integrates into every-day appliances, which can then connect with other devices to make the appliances more 'smart' or automated. For example, you could prepare food and place it in the oven for cooking prior to leaving the house for the day. You program your smart oven for the food you want it to cook. It would also be connected to your 'calendar of events' so that it could determine what time you should be available to eat and adjust start times and length of cooking accordingly. It could even adjust cooking times and temperatures based on changes in schedule. Additionally, a smart phone or tablet connection lets you connect to the oven directly, to make any desired adjustments. When the food is ready, the oven sends an alert message to you (or someone you specify) that the food is done and warming.

### 1.7.8 Powerline Networking

**Powerline networking** for home networks uses existing electrical wiring to connect devices. Using a standard powerline adapter, devices can connect to the LAN wherever there is an electrical outlet. No data cables need to be installed, and there is little to no additional electricity used. Using the same wiring that delivers electricity, powerline networking sends information by sending data on certain frequencies.

Powerline networking is especially useful when wireless access points cannot reach all the devices in the home. Powerline networking is not a substitute for dedicated cabling in data networks. However, it is an alternative when data network cables or wireless communications are not possible or effective.

### 1.7.9 Wireless Broadband

In many areas where cable and DSL are not available, wireless may be used to connect to the internet.

### Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP)

A **Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP)** is an ISP that connects subscribers to a designated access point or hot spot using similar wireless technologies found in home wireless local area networks (WLANs). WISPs are more commonly found in rural environments where DSL or cable services are not available.

Although a separate transmission tower may be installed for the antenna, typically the antenna is attached to an existing elevated structure, such as a water tower or a radio tower. A small dish or antenna is installed on the subscriber's roof in range of the WISP transmitter. The subscriber's access unit is connected to the wired network inside the home.

### Wireless Broadband Service

Another wireless solution for the home and small businesses is wireless broadband. This solution uses the same cellular technology as a smart phone. An antenna is installed outside the house providing either wireless or wired connectivity for devices in the home. In many areas, home wireless broadband is competing directly with DSL and cable services.

## 1.8 Network Security

### 1.8.1 Security Threats

Network security is an integral part of computer networking, regardless of whether the network is in a home with a single connection to the internet or is a corporation with thousands of users. Network security must consider the environment, as well as the tools and requirements of the network. It must be able to secure data while still allowing for the quality of service that users expect of the network.

Securing a network involves protocols, technologies, devices, tools, and techniques in order to protect data and mitigate threats. Threat vectors may be external or internal. Many external network security threats today originate from the internet.

**Common external threats to networks:**

- **Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses** — These contain malicious software or code running on a user device
- **Spyware and adware** — These are types of software which are installed on a user's device. The software then secretly collects information about the user
- **Zero-day attacks** — Also called zero-hour attacks, these occur on the first day that a vulnerability becomes known
- **Threat actor attacks** — A malicious person attacks user devices or network resources
- **Denial of service attacks** — These attacks slow or crash applications and processes on a network device
- **Data interception and theft** — This attack captures private information from an organization's network
- **Identity theft** — This attack steals the login credentials of a user in order to access private data

It is equally important to consider **internal threats**. There have been many studies that show that the most common data breaches happen because of internal users of the network. This can be attributed to lost or stolen devices, accidental misuse by employees, and in the business environment, even malicious employees. With the evolving BYOD strategies, corporate data is much more vulnerable. Therefore, when developing a security policy, it is important to address both external and internal security threats.

### 1.8.2 Security Solutions

No single solution can protect the network from the variety of threats that exist. For this reason, security should be implemented in multiple layers, using more than one security solution. If one security component fails to identify and protect the network, others may succeed.

A home network security implementation is usually rather basic. Typically, you implement it on the end devices, as well as at the point of connection to the internet, and can even rely on contracted services from the ISP.

**Basic security components for a home or small office network:**

- **Antivirus and antispyware** — These applications help to protect end devices from becoming infected with malicious software
- **Firewall filtering** — Firewall filtering blocks unauthorized access into and out of the network. This may include a host-based firewall system that prevents unauthorized access to the end device, or a basic filtering service on the home router to prevent unauthorized access from the outside world into the network

In contrast, the network security implementation for a corporate network usually consists of many components built into the network to monitor and filter traffic. Ideally, all components work together, which minimizes maintenance and improves security. Larger networks and corporate networks use antivirus, antispyware, and firewall filtering, but they also have other security requirements:

**Additional security requirements for corporate networks:**

- **Dedicated firewall systems** — These provide more advanced firewall capabilities that can filter large amounts of traffic with more granularity
- **Access control lists (ACL)** — These further filter access and traffic forwarding based on IP addresses and applications
- **Intrusion prevention systems (IPS)** — These identify fast-spreading threats, such as zero-day or zero-hour attacks
- **Virtual private networks (VPN)** — These provide secure access into an organization for remote workers

Network security requirements must consider the environment, as well as the various applications, and computing requirements. Both home and business environments must be able to secure their data while still allowing for the quality of service that users expect of each technology. Additionally, the security solution implemented must be adaptable to the growing and changing trends of the network.
