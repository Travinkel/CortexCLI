# **10.0.1 Why should I take this module?**

Welcome to Basic Router Configuration!

Have you ever run a relay? The first person runs the first leg of the race and hands off the baton to the next runner, who continues forward in the second leg of the race and hands off the baton to the third runner, and on it goes. Routing packets is very similar to a relay. But if the first runner does not know where to find the second runner, or drops the baton in the first leg, then that relay team will most certainly lose the race.

Routing packets is very similar to a relay. As you know, routing tables are created and used by routers to forward packets from their local networks on to other networks. But a router cannot create a routing table or forward any packets until it has been configured. If you plan to become a network administrator you definitely must know how to do this. The good news? It is easy! This module has Syntax Checker activities so that you can practice your configuration commands and see the output. There are also some Packet Tracer activities to get you started. Let’s go!

# **10.1.2 Basic Router Configuration Example**

In this example, router R1 in the topology diagram will be configured with initial settings.

The figure shows a network topology diagram with two PCs, two switches, two routers, and an internet cloud. From left to right PC 1 connects to a switch which connects to R1 which connects to R2 which connects to a second switch, which connects to PC2. PC1 is on the 192.168.10.0/24 IPv4 network and has IPv4 address 192.168.10.10. PC1 also connects to the 2001.db8:acad:10::/64 IPv6 network and has IPv6 address 2001:db8:acad:10::10. Router R1 G0/0/0 interface is on the same network as PC1. The IPv4 and IPv6 address of the G0/0/0 interface of R1 is 192.168.10.1 and 2001:db8:acad:10::1. The IPv4 network connecting R1 and R2 is 209.165.200.224/30. The IPv6 network connecting R1 and R2 is 2001:db8:feed:224::/64. R1 connects to R2 over interface G0/0/1 which has IPv4 address 209.165.200. 225 and IPv6 address 2001:db8:feed:224::1. The IP addresses for R2 on the shared network with R1 are 209.165.200. 226 and 2001:db8:feed:224::2. PC2 and R2 are connected on IPv4 network 10.1.1.0/24 and IPv6 network 2001:db8:cafe:1::/64. PC1 has IPv4 address 10.1.1.10 and IPv6 address 2001:db8:cafe::10. R2 has IPv4 address 10.1.1.1 and IPv6 address 2001:db8:cafe::1.

.10::10192.168.10.0/24.1::1G0/0/0G0/0/1.225::1.226::2.1::1209.165.200.224/3010.1.1.0/24.10::102001:db8:acad:10::/642001:db8:feed:224::/642001:db8:cafe:1::/64PC1PC2R1R2

**Internet**

To configure the device name for R1, use the following commands.

`Router> **enable**Router# **configure terminal**Enter configuration commands, one per line.End with CNTL/Z.Router(config)# **hostname R1**R1(config)#`

**Note:** Notice how the router prompt now displays the router hostname.

All router access should be secured. Privileged EXEC mode provides the user with complete access to the device and its configuration. Therefore, it is the most important mode to secure.

The following commands secure privileged EXEC mode and user EXEC mode, enable Telnet and SSH remote access, and encrypt all plaintext (i.e., user EXEC and VTY line) passwords.

`R1(config)# **enable secret class**R1(config)#R1(config)# **line console 0**R1(config-line)# **password cisco**R1(config-line)# **login**R1(config-line)# **exit**R1(config)#R1(config)# **line vty 0 4**R1(config-line)# **password cisco**R1(config-line)# **login**R1(config-line)# **transport input ssh telnet**R1(config-line)# **exit**R1(config)#R1(config)# **service password-encryption**R1(config)#`

The legal notification warns users that the device should only be accessed by permitted users. Legal notification is configured as follows.

`R1(config)# **banner motd #**Enter TEXT message. End with a new line and the #*************************************************WARNING: Unauthorized access is prohibited!***********************************************#**R1(config)#`

If the previous commands were configured and the router accidently lost power, all configured commands would be lost. For this reason, it is important to save the configuration when changes are implemented. The following command saves the configuration to NVRAM.

`R1# **copy running-config startup-config**Destination filename [startup-config]?Building configuration...[OK]R1#`

# **10.1.3 Syntax Checker - Configure Initial Router Settings**

Use this syntax checker to practice configuring the initial settings on a router.

- Configure the device name.
- Secure the privileged EXEC mode.
- Secure and enable remote SSH and Telnet access.
- Secure all plaintext passwords.

# **10.1.4 Packet Tracer - Configure Initial Router Settings**

In this activity, you will perform basic router configurations. You will secure access to the CLI and console port using encrypted and plaintext passwords. You will also configure messages for users logging into the router. These banners also warn unauthorized users that access is prohibited. Finally, you will verify and save your running configuration.

# 10.2 Configure Interfaces

Scroll to begin

# **10.2.1 Configure Router Interfaces**

At this point, your routers have their basic configurations. The next step is to configure their interfaces. This is because routers are not reachable by end devices until the interfaces are configured. There are many different types of interfaces available on Cisco routers. For example, the Cisco ISR 4321 router is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces:

- **GigabitEthernet 0/0/0 (G0/0/0)**
- **GigabitEthernet 0/0/1 (G0/0/1)**

The task to configure a router interface is very similar to a management SVI on a switch. Specifically, it includes issuing the following commands:

  `Router(config)# **interface** *type-and-number*    Router(config-if)# **description** *description-text*    Router(config-if)# **ip address**  *ipv4-address subnet-mask*    Router(config-if)# **ipv6 address**  *ipv6-address/prefix-length*    Router(config-if)# **no shutdown**`

**Note:** When a router interface is enabled, information messages should be displayed confirming the enabled link.

Although the **description** command is not required to enable an interface, it is good practice to use it. It can be helpful in troubleshooting on production networks by providing information about the type of network connected. For example, if the interface connects to an ISP or service carrier, the **description** command would be helpful to enter the third-party connection and contact information.

**Note:** The *description-text* is limited to 240 characters.

Using the **no shutdown** command activates the interface and is similar to powering on the interface. The interface must also be connected to another device, such as a switch or a router, for the physical layer to be active.

**Note:** On inter-router connections where there is no Ethernet switch, both interconnecting interfaces must be configured and enabled.

# **10.2.2 Configure Router Interfaces Example**

In this example, the directly connected interfaces of R1 in the topology diagram will be enabled.

The diagram is a network topology showing the IPv4 and IPv6 addressing of the network devices. What follows is a description of the topology from left to right. PC1 is connected to a switch connected to router R1. The network IPv4 address is 192.168.10.0/24 and the IPv6 address is 2001:db8:acad:10::/64. PC1 has an address of .10 and ::10. Interface G0/0/0 on R1 has an address of .1 and ::1. R1 interface G0/0/1 is then connected to router R2 on IPv4 network 209.165.200.224/30 and IPv6 network 2001:db8:feed:224::/64. Interface G0/0/1 on R1 has an address of .225 and ::1. The interface on R2 has an address of .226 and ::2. R2 is then connected to a switch which is connected to PC2 on IPv4 network 10.1.1.0/24 and IPv6 network 2001:db8:cafe:1::/64. The R2 interface has an address of .1 and ::1. PC2 has an address of .10 and ::10. R2 also has a connection to the Internet cloud.

To configure the the interfaces on R1, use the following commands.

`R1> **enable**R1# **configure terminal**Enter configuration commands, one per line.End with CNTL/Z.R1(config)# **interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0**R1(config-if)# **description Link to LAN**R1(config-if)# **ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0**R1(config-if)# **ipv6 address 2001:db8:acad:10::1/64**R1(config-if)# **no shutdown**R1(config-if)# **exit**R1(config)#*Aug  1 01:43:53.435: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0, changed state to down*Aug  1 01:43:56.447: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0, changed state to up*Aug  1 01:43:57.447: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0, changed state to upR1(config)#R1(config)#R1(config)# **interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/1**R1(config-if)# **description Link to R2**R1(config-if)# **ip address 209.165.200.225 255.255.255.252**R1(config-if)# **ipv6 address 2001:db8:feed:224::1/64**R1(config-if)# **no shutdown**R1(config-if)# **exit**R1(config)#*Aug  1 01:46:29.170: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1, changed state to down*Aug  1 01:46:32.171: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1, changed state to up*Aug  1 01:46:33.171: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1, changed state to upR1(config)#`

**Note:** Notice the informational messages informing us that G0/0/0 and G0/0/1 are enabled.

# **10.2.3 Verify Interface Configuration**

There are several commands that can be used to verify interface configuration. The most useful of these is the **show ip interface brief** and **show ipv6 interface brief** commands, as shown in the example.

# 10.3 Configure the Default Gateway

Scroll to begin

# **10.3.1 Default Gateway on a Host**

If your local network has only one router, it will be the gateway router and all hosts and switches on your network must be configured with this information. If your local network has multiple routers, you must select one of them to be the default gateway router. This topic explains how to configure the default gateway on hosts and switches.

For an end device to communicate over the network, it must be configured with the correct IP address information, including the default gateway address. The default gateway is only used when the host wants to send a packet to a device on another network. The default gateway address is generally the router interface address attached to the local network of the host. The IP address of the host device and the router interface address must be in the same network.

For example, assume an IPv4 network topology consisting of a router interconnecting two separate LANs. G0/0/0 is connected to network 192.168.10.0, while G0/0/1 is connected to network 192.168.11.0. Each host device is configured with the appropriate default gateway address.

In this example, if PC1 sends a packet to PC2, then the default gateway is not used. Instead, PC1 addresses the packet with the IPv4 address of PC2 and forwards the packet directly to PC2 through the switch.

![The diagram is a network topology with one router, two switches, and four PCs showing the flow of information between devices on the same network. PC1 and PC2 are connected to the switch on network 192.168.10.0/24 at interface G0/0/0 on router R1. PC3 and PC4 are connected to another switch on network 192.168.11.0/24 at interface G0/0/1 on R1. An arrow shows the flow of information sent from PC1 passing through the attached switch on its way to PC2.](https://www.netacad.com/content/itn/1.0/_assets/media/2e20ca50-1c25-11ea-a010-eb2108469056/2e20ca53-1c25-11ea-81a0-ffc2c49b96bc.svg)

What if PC1 sent a packet to PC3? PC1 would address the packet with the IPv4 address of PC3, but would forward the packet to its default gateway, which is the G0/0/0 interface of R1. The router accepts the packet and accesses its routing table to determine that G0/0/1 is the appropriate exit interface based on the destination address. R1 then forwards the packet out of the appropriate interface to reach PC3.

![The diagram is a network topology with one router, two switches, and four PCs showing the flow of information between devices on different networks. PC1 and PC2 are connected to the switch on network 192.168.10.0/24 at interface G0/0/0 on router R1. PC3 and PC4 are connected to another switch on network 192.168.11.0/24 at interface G0/0/1 on R1. An arrow shows the flow of information sent from PC1 passing through R1 and onto PC3.](https://www.netacad.com/content/itn/1.0/_assets/media/2e20f160-1c25-11ea-a010-eb2108469056/2e20f161-1c25-11ea-81a0-ffc2c49b96bc.svg)

The same process would occur on an IPv6 network, although this is not shown in the topology. Devices would use the IPv6 address of the local router as their default gateway.

# **10.3.2 Default Gateway on a Switch**

A switch that interconnects client computers is typically a Layer 2 device. As such, a Layer 2 switch does not require an IP address to function properly. However, an IP configuration can be configured on a switch to give an administrator remote access to the switch.

To connect to and manage a switch over a local IP network, it must have a switch virtual interface (SVI) configured. The SVI is configured with an IPv4 address and subnet mask on the local LAN. The switch must also have a default gateway address configured to remotely manage the switch from another network.

The default gateway address is typically configured on all devices that will communicate beyond their local network.

To configure an IPv4 default gateway on a switch, use the **ip default-gateway** *ip-address* global configuration command. The *ip-address* that is configured is the IPv4 address of the local router interface connected to the switch.

The figure shows an administrator establishing a remote connection to switch S1 on another network.

The diagram is a network topology showing a router R1 connected to two switches, S1 on network 192.168.10.0/24, and S2 on network 192.168.11.0/24. A user is connected to S2 and an arrow shows the user is accessing S1 remotely. Above the user is a box showing the user has CLI access to S1 and is displaying the running configuration.

In this example, the administrator host would use its default gateway to send the packet to the G0/0/1 interface of R1. R1 would forward the packet to S1 out of its G0/0/0 interface. Because the packet source IPv4 address came from another network, S1 would require a default gateway to forward the packet to the G0/0/0 interface of R1. Therefore, S1 must be configured with a default gateway to be able to reply and establish an SSH connection with the administrative host.

**Note:** Packets originating from host computers connected to the switch must already have the default gateway address configured on their host computer operating systems.

A workgroup switch can also be configured with an IPv6 address on an SVI. However, the switch does not require the IPv6 address of the default gateway to be configured manually. The switch will automatically receive its default gateway from the ICMPv6 Router Advertisement message from the router.

# **10.3.5 Packet Tracer - Troubleshoot Default Gateway Issues**

For a device to communicate across multiple networks, it must be configured with an IP address, subnet mask, and a default gateway. The default gateway is used when the host wants to send a packet to a device on another network. The default gateway address is generally the router interface address attached to the local network to which the host is connected. In this activity, you will finish documenting the network. You will then verify the network documentation by testing end-to-end connectivity and troubleshooting issues. The troubleshooting method you will use consists of the following steps:

1. Verify the network documentation and use tests to isolate problems.
2. Determine an appropriate solution for a given problem.
3. Implement the solution.
4. Test to verify the problem is resolved.

2. Secure privileged EXEC mode.
3. Secure user EXEC mode.
4. Secure remote Telnet / SSH access.
5. Secure all passwords in the config file.

**Configure Interfaces**

For routers to be reachable, the router interfaces must be configured. The Cisco ISR 4321 router is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces: GigabitEthernet 0/0/0 (G0/0/0) and GigabitEthernet 0/0/1 (G0/0/1). The tasks to configure a router interface are very similar to a management SVI on a switch. Using the **no shutdown** command activates the interface. The interface must also be connected to another device, such as a switch or a router, for the physical layer to be active. There are several commands that can be used to verify interface configuration including the **show ip interface brief** and **show ipv6 interface brief**, the **show ip route** and **show ipv6 route**, as well as **show interfaces**, **show ip interface** and **show ipv6 interface.**

**Configure the Default Gateway**

For an end device to communicate over the network, it must be configured with the correct IP address information, including the default gateway address. The default gateway address is generally the router interface address for the router that is attached to the local network of the host. The IP address of the host device and the router interface address must be in the same network. To connect to and manage a switch over a local IP network, it must have a switch virtual interface (SVI) configured. The SVI is configured with an IPv4 address and subnet mask on the local LAN. The switch must also have a default gateway address configured to remotely manage the switch from another network. To configure an IPv4 default gateway on a switch, use the **ip default-gateway ip-address** global configuration command. Use the IPv4 address of the local router interface that is connected to the switch.
