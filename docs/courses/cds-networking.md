## Processing Strategy

1. **Deduplicate against CCNA**: Similarity threshold 0.85
2. **Focus on procedural**: Lab configurations, Packet Tracer
3. **EASV-specific content**: Exam format, local requirements
4. **Link to CCNA concepts**: Reuse existing concept hierarchy

## Estimated Output

| Type | Count |
|------|-------|
| New flashcards | ~800 |
| New cloze | ~400 |
| New MCQ | ~200 |
| Deduplicated (CCNA overlap) | ~500 |
