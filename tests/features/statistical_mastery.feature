Feature: Statistical Mastery & Gøtzsche-tier Bias Detection
  As an Epistemic Skepticism Agent (Gøtzsche),
  I want to force the user to identify structural flaws in raw clinical trial data,
  In order to develop elite-level scientific integrity and bias detection.

  Scenario: Identify Publication Bias
    Given a dataset of clinical trials,
    When I analyze the data for publication bias,
    Then the system should flag trials with a high risk of bias.
