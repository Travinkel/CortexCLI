# =============================================================================
# RECOMMENDED STUDY ORDER (respects prerequisites)
# =============================================================================
#
# PHASE 1 - Layer 2 Foundation (Start with your weakest area):
#   1. Module 4 (Physical) - 1 session
#   2. Module 5 (Ethernet/Switching) - 2-3 sessions (CRITICAL)
#   3. Module 7 (MAC/Frames) - 1-2 sessions
#
# PHASE 2 - Layer 3 Addressing (parallel with CLI if needed):
#   4. Module 8 (IPv4 Subnetting) - 2-3 sessions (CRITICAL)
#   5. Module 10 (IPv6) - 1-2 sessions
#   6. Module 9 (ARP/ND) - 2 sessions (CRITICAL)
#
# PHASE 3 - Upper Layers:
#   7. Module 11 (ICMP) - 1-2 sessions (CRITICAL)
#   8. Module 12 (TCP/UDP) - 1 session
#   9. Module 13 (DNS/DHCP/HTTP) - 1 session
#
# PARALLEL TRACK (study alongside Phases 1-3):
#   - Module 2 (IOS Navigation) - as needed
#   - Module 3 (OSI Model) - reference frequently
